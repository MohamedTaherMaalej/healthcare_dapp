## Technologies Used

Healthcare_DApp leverages the following technologies to provide a robust and secure healthcare experience:

- **Flutter**: The frontend is developed using Flutter, a popular open-source framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

- **Solidity**: Ethereum's smart contract language, Solidity, is used to create, deploy, and manage smart contracts on the blockchain.

- **Truffle**: Truffle is a development framework that simplifies Ethereum smart contract development, testing, and deployment.

- **Ganache**: Ganache is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development, allowing you to test your smart contracts in a local environment.

- **Remix**: Remix is a powerful web-based IDE for Solidity, providing a convenient interface for writing and deploying smart contracts.

## Features

Healthcare_DApp offers the following key features for an advanced mobile healthcare experience:

1. **User Management**: Users can create and manage their accounts, securely storing their healthcare data on the Ethereum blockchain.

2. **Authorization**: Healthcare_DApp ensures secure authorization between doctors and patients, granting access to medical records and related information only to authorized personnel.

3. **Records Management**: Patients can manage their medical records, including prescriptions, test results, and medical history, all securely stored on the blockchain.
